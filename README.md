# Ludum Dare 43

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Must have [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk10-downloads-4416644.html) installed. I know it works with Java 8 and above.

Graphics driver must have support for OpenGL 3.3 Core or later

### What's this all about?
This project is my game for Ludum Dare 43. If you don't know what [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/about) is and you're into making games then definitely check it out [here](https://ldjam.com/about).

### So what's the game?
You play as a Abraham and you must sacrifice as many rams and babies as you can before you die. 

### Can I play it?
Of course! Here's how:

Click [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ayQ1LG34oj0QPHYh2H4Rlx5nJaYssU9i) to download the game. Once you've downloaded it extract the zip file and run the jar file. In addition I
didn't add a help menu due to time being a bit limited so go [here](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/abaraham) if you want help.

Of course you can always download the source and compile it yourself. You are going to need [LWJGL 3](https://www.lwjgl.org/download). Make sure to include JOML under **Addons**
